# ADMIXTOOLS 2

A new, lightning fast implementation of [*ADMIXTOOLS*](https://github.com/DReichLab/AdmixTools).


## Overview

*ADMIXTOOLS* is a collection of programs which use genetic data to infer how populations are related to one another. It has been used in countless publications to test whether populations form clades (*qpDstat*, *qpWave*), to estimate ancestry proportions (*qpAdm*), and to fit admixture graphs (*qpGraph*).

*ADMIXTOOLS 2* provides the same functionality as *ADMIXTOOLS* in a new look, and it's orders of magnitude faster. This is achieved through separating the computation of *f*~2~-statistics from all other computations, and through a number of other optimizations. In the example below, rendering the plot takes much longer than computing the fit of a new *qpGraph* model:

## Features

* Much faster than the original *ADMIXTOOLS* software
* Simple R command line interface
* Even simpler point-and-click interface
* Several new features and methodological innovations that make it easier to find robust models:
  + [Automated and semi-automated admixture graph inference](html#exploring-different-graphs-1)
  + Simultaneous exploration of many *qpAdm* models
  + Unbiased comparison of any two *qpGraph* models using out-of-sample scores
  + Jackknife and bootstrap standard errors and confidence intervals for any *qpAdm*, *qpWave*, and *qpGraph* parameters
  + Interface with *msprime* makes it easy to [simulate](https://uqrmaie1.github.io/admixtools/articles/graphs.html#simulating-under-an-admixture-graph-1) genetic data under an admixture graph
* Full support for genotype data in *PACKEDANCESTRYMAP/EIGENSTRAT* format and *PLINK* format
* Wrapper functions around the original *ADMIXTOOLS* software (see also [admixr](https://bodkan.net/admixr/index.html))
<!-- * Simple interface with [msprime](https://msprime.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for simulating under a given admixture graph -->
* [Extensive documentation](https://uqrmaie1.github.io/admixtools/articles/admixtools.html)
* New features available [on request](mailto:rmaier@broadinstitute.org)!


## Installation

*ADMIXTOOLS 2* is currently still under active development. Most of it has already been tested extensively, but functionality is still added and may change here and there. *ADMIXTOOLS 2* is not yet on the CRAN servers (so you can't install it with `install.packages()`), but you can install it from github with the following commands (provided you have R version 3.5 or higher):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools") # if "devtools" is not installed already
devtools::install_github("uqrmaie1/admixtools")
library("admixtools")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=FALSE}
library('admixtools')
```

The above commands will install all R package dependencies which are required to run *ADMIXTOOLS 2* on the command line. For the interactive app, additional packages are required, which can be installed like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("uqrmaie1/admixtools", dependencies = TRUE)
```

If you encounter any problems during the installation, this is most likely because some of the required R packages cannot be installed. If that happens, try manually re-installing some of the larger packages, and pay attention to any error message:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("Rcpp")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("igraph")
install.packages("plotly")
```

Running `devtools::install_github("uqrmaie1/admixtools")` will compile C++ from source code (this isn't necessary when installing packages from CRAN with `install.packages()`).

If you get the following error:

`Error: Failed to install 'admixtools' from GitHub:  Could not find tools necessary to compile a package.`

you might be able to solve the problem by installing [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) for your version of R if you use Windows, or [Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/) if you use macOS. This is also described [here](https://r-pkgs.org/setup.html#setup-tools).

On some Linux distributions, it may be necessary to manually install additional libraries or programs. For example, if you see the error `gfortran: command not found` during installation, you would have to install `gfortan` with `sudo zypper in gfortran` or `sudo apt-get install gfortran`, depending on the Linux distribution.


If you get any other errors during installation, please [contact me](mailto:rmaier@broadinstitute.org).


## Usage

Admixture graphs can be fitted like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
genotype_data = "/my/geno/prefix"
fit = qpgraph(genotype_data, example_graph)
fit$score
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
fit = qpgraph(example_f2_blocks, example_graph)
fit$score
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot_graph(fit$edges)
```


![example graph](man/figures/graph1.png)
Clearly not a historically accurate model, but it gets the idea across.

<br>

When testing more than one model, it makes sense to extract and re-use f2-statistics:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
f2_blocks = f2_from_geno(genotype_data)
fit = qpgraph(f2_blocks, example_graph)
```
```{r}
fit$score
```


<br>

*f*~2~-statistics can also be used to estimate admixture weights: 
```{r}
left = c("Altai_Neanderthal.DG", "Vindija.DG")
right = c("Chimp.REF", "Mbuti.DG", "Russia_Ust_Ishim.DG", "Switzerland_Bichon.SG")
target = "Denisova.DG"
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
qpadm(f2_blocks, left, right, target)$weights
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
qpadm(example_f2_blocks, left, right, target, verbose = FALSE)$weights
```

<br>

Or to get *f*~4~-statistics:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
f4(f2_blocks)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
f4(example_f2_blocks)
```

## Interactive browser app

*ADMIXTOOLS 2* also has a simple point-and-click interface. This makes it easy to explore many *qpAdm* or *qpGraph* models at the same time, for example by allowing you to build and change admixture graphs interactively.
Typing the following command in the R console launches the app:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
run_shiny_admixtools()
```

## Documentation

One of the design goals behind *ADMIXTOOLS 2* is to make the algorithms more transparent, so that the steps leading from from genotype data to conclusions about demographic history are easier to follow. 

To this end, all *ADMIXTOOLS 2* functions are [documented](https://uqrmaie1.github.io/admixtools/reference/index.html). You can also take a look at the [tutorial](articles/admixtools.html), read more about how *ADMIXTOOLS 2* computes [f-statistics](https://uqrmaie1.github.io/admixtools/articles/fstats.html) and [standard errors](https://uqrmaie1.github.io/admixtools/articles/resampling.html), and what you can do with [admixture graphs](https://uqrmaie1.github.io/admixtools/articles/graphs.html).

For even greater transparency, many of the core functions are implemented twice: In C++ for performance (used by default), and in R, which makes it easier to trace the computations step by step. For example, if you want to know how weights are computed in `qpadm()`, you can type `qpadm` in R to get the function code and you will see another function which is called `qpadm_weights()`. By default, this function will be replaced by its faster C++ version `cpp_qpadm_weights()`. But you can still see what it's doing without reading the C++ code by typing `admixtools:::qpadm_weights`. And you can tell `qpadm()` to use the R versions instead of the C++ versions by calling `qpadm(cpp = FALSE)`.
