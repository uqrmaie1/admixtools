\arguments{
\item{pref}{Prefix of \emph{(packed)ancestrymap} or \emph{PLINK} files. \emph{(packed)ancestrymap} has to end in \code{.geno}, \code{.snp}, \code{.ind},
PLINK has to end in \code{.bed}, \code{.bim}, \code{.fam}}

\item{outdir}{Directory where data will be stored.}

\item{inds}{Individuals for which data should be read. Defaults to all individuals}

\item{blgsize}{SNP block size in Morgan. Default is 0.05 (50 cM). If \code{blgsize} is 100 or greater, if will be interpreted as base pair distance rather than centimorgan distance.}

\item{maxmiss}{Discard SNPs which are missing in a fraction of individuals greater than \code{maxmiss}}

\item{minmaf}{Discard SNPs with minor allele frequency less than \code{minmaf}}

\item{maxmaf}{Discard SNPs with minor allele frequency greater than than \code{maxmaf}}

\item{transitions}{Set this to \code{FALSE} to exclude transition SNPs}

\item{transversions}{Set this to \code{FALSE} to exclude transversion SNPs}

\item{auto_only}{Keep only SNPs on chromosomes 1 to 22}

\item{keepsnps}{SNP IDs of SNPs to keep. Overrides other SNP filtering options}

\item{maxmem}{Maximum amount of memory to be used. If the required amount of memory exceeds \code{maxmem}, allele frequency data will be split into blocks, and the computation will be performed separately on each block pair.}

\item{overwrite}{Overwrite existing files in \code{outdir}}

\item{format}{Supply this if the prefix can refer to genotype data in different formats
and you want to choose which one to read. Should be \code{plink} to read \code{.bed}, \code{.bim}, \code{.fam} files, or \code{ancestrymap}, or \code{packedancestrymap} to read \code{.geno}, \code{.snp}, \code{.ind} files.}

\item{cols_per_chunk}{Number of genotype chunks to store on disk. Setting this to a positive integer makes the function slower, but requires less memory. The default value for \code{cols_per_chunk} in \code{\link{extract_afs}} is 10. Lower numbers will lower the memory requirement but increase the time it takes.}

\item{verbose}{Print progress updates}
}
\description{
Prepare data for various \emph{ADMIXTOOLS 2} functions. This function reads data from packedancestrymap or PLINK files,
and extracts data required to compute blocked f-statistics for any sets of samples. The data consists of
\code{.rds} files with total and alternative allele counts for each individual, and products of total
and alternative allele counts for each pair.
The function calls \code{\link{packedancestrymap_to_afs}} or \code{\link{plink_to_afs}}
and \code{\link{afs_to_f2_blocks}}.
